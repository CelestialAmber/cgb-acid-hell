# cgb-acid-hell
This is a cleaned up and documented version of the cgb-acid-hell test created by mattcurie. The test
is programmed in a very unorthodox way that abuses edge cases/quirks in the hardware (for example with
the halt instruction and interrupts), including relying on a PPU bug in order to render the graphics.
There's also several additional red herrings meant to mislead someone trying to understand the test, making it all the more confusing.

Look at the code if you dare ðŸ˜ˆ

## Reference Image
To pass this test an emulator should generate output identical to the image below:
